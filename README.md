# Space Station readme

Space Station lets you see the live location of the international space station (ISS) as it orbits over the earth. I first saw the ISS moving across the night sky a few months ago. I had no idea it moved so fast (orbits the earth 15 times a day) and was so visible. I thought it would be fun to make an app which showed where it was over the earth and gave you the next few times when it would be visible.

### Instructions.

No signup required, just head on over to the app to get started! You can plot your own location on the map (chrome will ask you for permission) and get a list of the next times the international space station will be visible over your location. Then enter your email address to get a one off email with the pass over times.

### Technologies / structure:
